  <h1>Productivity</h1>
</div>

<p>
  Productivity is topic that often is ignored by a
  lot programmer. I have seen a bunch of documents
  out there talking about algorithm and data structure,
  so I would like to post a topic about productivity
  for an advanced programmer or for the programmer
  who wants to be a better programmer. So what exactly
  mean productivity in software development field? If
  you have seen my previous blog post '
  <a href="?page=Framework_sp_I_sp_have_sp_been_sp_working_sp_-Part_sp_1-">
    Framework I have been working... (Part 1)
  </a>
  ' and '
  <a href="?page=Framework_sp_I_sp_have_sp_been_sp_working_sp_-Part_sp_2-">
    Framework I have been working... (Part 2)
  </a>
  ', then you might already know what I am going
  to write about for the rest of this article.
</p>

  So what essentially methods that we could do to
  improve the productivity for ourselves as a software
  engineer? First of all, I would say build your tools.
  Anything that could speed up the development process
  will increase the productivity of the project. It
  sounds straightforward to make your tools or library,
  but when you start making it, it actually kind of
  hard to make. That I have heard of a lot of people
  asking me how to make a library for other people
  to use?
</p>

<p>
  Building a tool is hard and time-consuming. The
  first thing to make your tool is to have learned
  Design Pattern (I have already mentioned few books
  I recommend in my previous post - '
  <a href="?page=Framework_sp_I_sp_have_sp_been_sp_working_sp_-Part_sp_1-">
    Framework I have been working... [Part 1]
  </a>
  '). Attention, learn design pattern is to learn
  how to build a better software architecture. Not
  to learn how to use a design pattern in your code!
  I have seen programmers use design pattern all the
  time and feel bad about it because they seem to be
  attempt to use design pattern instead of designing
  a software architecture.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
  Once you have the skill and knowledge of design
  pattern. I would recommend seeing how other people
  build their tools on any open source platform.
  As everyone knows GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, etc.
  Designing tools are thinking about how to make
  other programmers feel comfortable when using
  your tool. Think what kind of params have to pass
  into this function? Think is this feature that is
  needed to be here/design?
