  <h2>Acknowledge:</h2><br/>

  I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine. In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying "Data Structure", "Algorithms", "Design Patterns". What I presume that Design Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc.

  <br/><br/>

  On top of these concepts, this is the third framework I built. I could not remember what I built for the previous two framworks. I presume that I have some knowledge about building a framework, library, etc. At the beginning of the JCSUnity development process, I have had studied the basis of the game engine architecture but not quite fully understand the Unity Engine itself. For instance, Unity Engine's Scripting API, and some controls specific for Unity Eninge. Because of this, you might realized some of the code or design are a bit fiddle and inconsistent.

  <br/><br/>

  When I am writing this article, the framework itself has been developed to the state that is convoluted and hard to maintain. Within this framework, there are around 400 to 500 scripts, most of the scripts are self executed which mean a script is a component that could run by it own. By this idea, one self executed script benefits the design and increase the variation possibility but it also brings the cost of unnecessary performance.
