  <h2>Acknowledge:</h2><br/>

  I have developed this tool for 3 years. Starting from the third year of my college years. Compare to other framework I had developed, this tool have much more completeness. I have been using Unity Engine for 2 years while I decide to develop this framework. I have made cetain of games in this 2 years and I reckon I gained enough experiences to develop a framework for Unity Engine. In the retrospect, that was the time I have just done studying "Data Structure", "Algorithms", "Design Patterns". What I presume that Design Patterns are the vital part to a game development because game are often built by multiple components or modules. What I meant multiple are refer as really a lot of those. On the other hand, most software development would not requires that many of the systems, generally the reasons are most of the environment have been wrap or encapsulate by the former developers. For instances, .NET Frameowrk, Visual BASIC/C++/C#, NetBean Graphic, etc.

  <br/><br/>

  On top of these concepts, this is the third framework I built. I could not remember what I built for the previous two framworks. I presume that I have some knowledge about building a framework, library, etc. At the beginning of the JCSUnity development process, I have had studied the basis of the game engine architecture but not quite fully understand the Unity Engine itself. For instance, Unity Engine's Scripting API, and some controls specific for Unity Eninge. Because of this, you might realized some of the code or design are a bit fiddle and inconsistent.

  <br/><br/>

  When I am writing this article, the framework itself has been developed to the state that is convoluted and hard to maintain. Within this framework, there are around 400 to 500 scripts, most of the scripts are self executed which mean a script is a component that could run by it own. By this idea, one Self-Runnable Script benefits the design and increase the variation possibility but it also brings the cost of unnecessary performance.

  <h2>Introduction:</h2><br/>

  JCSUnity is a component driven framework built to allow users to quickly generate commonly used game mechanics or features. The architecture design of JCSUnity come alone to Unity Engine's design, which makes the framework highly compatible with Unity Engine itself. Every time the Unity Engine release an update, there should not be any issues to JCSUnity. This framework increases the productivity of game developers and enhances the game development process. Base my own experiences, the game originally that would spend my 15 weeks, I could compress development time to around 3 to 4 weeks. JCSUnity has most of the game presets that Unity Engine does not usually provide. For instance, switch scene with fade in and out, background music player, automatically adjust the screen to aspect ratio, etc. With all these presets, allow the game developers are more likely can be more focus on the design of the game instead of worrying all these trivial features.

  <h2>Self-Runnable Script:</h2><br/>

  Therefore, what is Self-Runnable Script? For example, here is a list of three SRSs.
  <br/><br/>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1.</td>
      <td>繞圓圈行為</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2.</td>
      <td>震動效果</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.</td>
      <td>上下搖擺效果 (Cosine Wave)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
