  <h1>Welcome to the <span class="blog-name"></span>'s Blog!</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to My blog. I don't think there are particular thing that I am talent with. In fact, I don't even believe that someone is born with some sort of destiny to do something. I much better believe in paying off hard works could attain anything. I never believe in god, and if there is a god then I would think he done poorly to my life. I'm a bit lazy, like to have some personal spaces with people, and like to contemplate with thing that stimulate my curiosity. Enjoy observing people, emtions, and deducting future by present facts. If you want to know more about me, check out <a href="?page=About_sp_Me_sp_-_sp_關於我">this</a>.

  歡迎來到我的部落格，我並沒有在哪個地方特別突出，也不是個相信天資論的人。唯有努力才能造就一切。我也不相信神，如果真的有神，那他已經把我的生活弄的足夠糟了。我並不是個很勤勞的人，喜歡獨處，以及思考一切讓我覺得好奇的事物。喜歡觀察人，情感，以及揣測未來。如果對我這樣的人有興趣，可以看「關於我」這篇。

  At the year 2013, I'm in love with Computer Science. I have my own thoughts about this field of study and aesthetics. I made this blog website out of nothing, basically from scratch using basic of HTML/CSS/JS for frontend and Node.js for backend. By having some of the software development experiences, I would like to share what I undergo while making software on this blog site.

  在2013年喜歡上了計算機領域，對這領域有特別的美學及見解。這個部落格也是我從無到有自己建出來的。有了一些在這領域的經驗後，打算在這裡寫下一些自己的開發經歷以及感想。

  I do like some other field of studies, but I would only consider myself as an amateur. The reason is simple, the time I spent on these field of studies isn't long enough to call myself an expert. I like physics; it explained everything that seems regular in daily life. I font mathematics, it interprets the thoughts into a substantial symbol or formula. I enjoy philosophy; it makes human thinks. One of my favorite quotes is "Knowledge is Power."
  <br/><br/>

  在其他領域也有極大的興趣，不過只能算是業餘的研究者。喜歡物理，把生活周遭的一切合理。喜歡數學，把一切合理化的東西寫成一個簡單的符號/公式。喜歡哲學，讓人類思考的源學。其中最喜歡的名言「知識就是力量」。
  <br/><br/>

  喜歡心理學，揣測人心。了解過去，現在，未來來做統合的判斷。有強大的水平思考能力，相對的垂直思考就遜色許多。喜歡判斷模擬人類的四種天性，善良，邪惡，理性，靈性。
